# Coding Exercise

Preparing for the coding interview.

## How to practice a question

1. Try to solve the problem on your own.
2. Write the code for the algorithm on paper.
3. Test your code on paper.
4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer.

## Five steps to a technical question

1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.
2. Design an Algorithm.
3. Write pseudocode first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you'll eventually write "real" code.
4. Write your code at a moderate pace.
5. Test your code and *carefully* fix any mistakes.
